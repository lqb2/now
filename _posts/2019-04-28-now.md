### making sure everyone reads this general note (through sept 2019)

i am going through a period of intensive spiritual formation from oct 2018 - sept 2019. <!-- i am taking this time now because i believe that it is part of my work in this age to hold and make space for meaning-making in our increasingly chaotic world. my capacity to hold that space is directly linked to depth of my leadership.  -->in order to say yes to my spiritual development, i am saying no almost everything that i am not currently committed to. you can see this list of existing commitments below:

* close friends and niblings <!-- (asa, alvie, jayden, leah) -->
* paid work: [center for story-based strategy (css)](https://storybasedstrategy.org), lqb2 & co consulting work
* communities of practice: evolutionary leadership, consultant coffee, the upstarts, boston movement space(s)
* boards: RESIST, FII
* making with my hands: calligraphy, knitting
* making with sound: life radio, post-patriarchal, intersectional enneagram
* making with my mind: unleashing alternative futures, pre-/post-patriarchal time travel
* all things healing, especially for queer folx and men

### here's a more temporal update, though. right now i'm:

* feeling magical after celebrating my 30th birthday. i'm feeling great and aligned about the end of my saturn return season
* working 1/2 time at css, working 1/2 time for lqb2 & co 
* still deep in my spiritual leadership development work (via the formation project)
* exploring (because of the above bullet): grief, anger, restorative vs transformative justice, wealth/financial trauma, generosity
* loving poetry more and more these days
* practicing uncling and loving it
* learning that a 30yo doesn't heal like a 20yo body. #yikes!
* hosting: monthly ga(y)me day on the last saturday of each month (next one: june 29), monthly queer jp movie night (next one: june 5, 6p), monthly queer full moon circles for men/male-bodied folx
