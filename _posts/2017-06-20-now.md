* still [writing a lot](https://lqb2.github.io/blog/) though i've loosened up a bit on the dailyness of it (mostly because of my hectic travel schedule). i've almost completely let go of my timing cap. sometimes i don't write at all and other days i write for 20-40 minutes.
* working on integrating things i learned at [evolutionary leadership](https://lqb2.github.io/blog/tags/#evolutionary leadership-ref)

* preparing to teach a workshop called *personal storytelling and social change* in partnership with [the prx podcast garage](https://www.podcastgarage.org) and [east meets west](http://www.emwbookstore.com/)
* testing out calendly as a new addition to manage scheduling headaches (in lieu of hiring an assistant, which i still want to do)
