### making sure everyone reads this general note (through sept 2019)

i am going through a period of intensive spiritual formation from oct 2018 - sept 2019. <!-- i am taking this time now because i believe that it is part of my work in this age to hold and make space for meaning-making in our increasingly chaotic world. my capacity to hold that space is directly linked to depth of my leadership.  -->in order to say yes to myself and my own growth, i am saying no almost everything that i am not currently committed to. those existing commitments are:

* close friends and niblings <!-- (asa, alvie, jayden, leah) -->
* paid work: [center for story-based strategy (css)](https://storybasedstrategy.org), consulting via [lqb2 & co](http://lqb2.co) (facilitation, coaching, speaking, education)
* communities of practice: [evolutionary leadership](https://www.gibranrivera.com/the-community), consultant coffee, the upstarts, boston movement space(s)
* boards: [RESIST](https://resist.org), [Family Independence Initiatve (FII)]()
* making with my hands: calligraphy, knitting
* making with sound: life radio, [post-patriarchal](https://postpatriarchalradio.tumblr.com), [intersectional enneagram](https://intersectionalenneagram.tumblr.com)
* making with my mind: [unleashing alternative futures](https://unleashingalternativefutures.wordpress.com), pre-/post-patriarchal time travel
* all things healing (especially for queer folx and men)

### here's the more temporal update, though. right now i'm:

* working 1/2 time at css, working 1/2 time for myself via lqb2 & co 
* still deep in my spiritual leadership development work (via the formation project)
* still exploring and unpacking (because of the above bullet): grief, anger, restorative vs transformative justice, wealth/financial trauma, generosity
* learning that a 30yo doesn't heal like a 20yo body. #yikes!
* hosting: [monthly board ga(y)me day](http://lqb2.co/blog///2019/04/17/gayme-day/) on the last saturday of each month (next one: july 20), monthly [queer jp movie night](http://lqb2.co/blog///2019/03/06/jp-queer-movie-night/) (next one: june 5, 6p), [monthly queer full moon circles for men/male-bodied folx](http://lqb2.co/blog///2019/05/14/queer-full-moon-circles/)
