hi, 

in days of the twin pandemics of covid-19 and racialized violence, a lot is happening. as a black person who grew up in many majority white spaces and institutions (PWIs), i am a large number of people's black friend. as such, i am getting a LOT of "how are you?" texts. on days when there is a lot of action in the news, i sometimes receive 10-20 of these texts and emails. 

if you are reading this, don't doubt the strength of our relationship. *and* please know that i may not have capacity to respond to you, regardless of your racial identities. sometimes i can, but often i can't. if i answered them all, i wouldn't have time to do really anything else. 

send me notes that you're thinking of me but understand if i don't respond for days or weeks. 

thanks!
