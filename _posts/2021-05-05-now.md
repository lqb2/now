## Right now I'm...

preparing to transition out of my staff position as network engagement manager at the center for story-based strategy and feeling pretty overwhelmed by it. i am also reading a shitton (i've finished 14 books this year already) and probably doing way too much organizing projects. i'm baking sourdough about 1x/week which feels greeeeeat. and, after my 2nd covid vax shot on 3 may, i'm reflecting on what it will mean to be vaccinated in a world where entire countries can't get enough vaccines to vaccinate even their medical professionals.
