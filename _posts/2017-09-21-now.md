## Right now I'm...

* the program director of community media at [mit colab][colab] & also running [colab radio][colab radio].
* writing: ([blogging almost daily](https://lqb2.github.io/blog/)) and working on a draft of my first book.
* building [my coaching practice](https://lqb2.github.io/productivity/coaching.html) and stepping into personal identity work (via websites) with a couple of friends...
* obsessed with [swarming](http://colabradio.mit.edu/swarming-to-learn-learning-to-swarm-online-interactive-book-club-reflection/) and (to experiment with swarming infrastructure) helping to run/support several book clubs/reading groups including one with my friend [nene](https://neveraprofessor.tumblr.com/) called [collective courage](https://collectivecouragebookclub.wordpress.com/) and another one with some [evolutionary leaders](https://www.gibranrivera.com/blog/evolutionaryleadership) on [emergent strategy](http://bit.ly/ReadingEmergentStrategy).
* preping round two of a workshop on personal storytelling for social change at [the prx podcast garage](https://www.podcastgarage.org).
* working on two podcasts with friends: [the intersectional enneagram](https://soundcloud.com/lawrence-barriner-ii/intersectional-enneagram-pilot-episode) with [abe](http://www.risksomething.org/) and cocktail weenies/long distance drunk with sam (not yet public).
* winding down my garden for the season: eating all my ripe tomatoes and saving some of their seeds, bringing rosemary cuttings indoors, trying to get my basil to go to seed.
* resettling into a fall routine where i'm not always out of town.
* freaking out about these hurricanes and earthquakes and fires and everything.
