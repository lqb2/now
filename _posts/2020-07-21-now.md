# how am i? 

i had a (mostly) vacation july 3-10 and it was much needed. i am back with lots of rest and insight and vision for what's possible in the moments. 

i am grateful for learning that reading is a way that i rest. i am learning that my pandemic reading practice different signficantly from my non-pandemic reading practice. here's all that i'm reading in the moment. note: two books i'm reading on kindle do not appear: children of virtue and vengeance by adeyemi as well as notes of a native son by baldin.

i am loving napping (which usually just means lying down for 20m and noticing my heart racing). 

i am tending to my back which alternates between feeling fine and feeling like it's on fire from all these calls. i even got a nice fancy desk chair and i think there's no amount of ergonomics that will solve for 14h at a computer. 

i am tending to some heartbreak and noticing how i move towards and away from my grief. practicing, practicing, practicing. 

i am loving all the CSA veggies i'm getting these days.
